### Recursive Gymnastics

1.   Write a recursive function that accepts a single, integer parameter "n". If n is positive, the function should recursively print all odd numbers 1 through n (or through n-1 if n is even).

2.   Next, write a recursive function that prints all the even numbers 2 through n... but in reverse.

3.   Finally, write a recursive function that prints n! for all numbers 1 through n.
