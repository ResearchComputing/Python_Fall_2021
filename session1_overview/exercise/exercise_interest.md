The file *interest_info.txt* contains information related to the user's bank account deposit. The first line contains the annual interest rate.  The second line contains the number of times the interest is compounded per year.   The third line contains the principal amount.   Suppose that the user wishes to know her current balance.    

Write a program that reads the information contained in this file and then asks the user how many years have passed since the initial deposit.    The program should then indicate the current balance in dollar/cents format (with 2 decimal points).  See session1_overview/formatting_numbers.py for some examples of how to format numeric output.
